# Museum of Candy
On this and any directory/file marked "Project," it was a coding challenge. You would given a task and then your goal was to go do it..or you could watch Colt code it. I always chose to make projects myself and then go back and review them, watching Colt's decision-making. With this page, you're combining HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a fairly aesthetically-pleasing landing page for a...museum of candy. It turned out looking not too bad, if a little washed out for my liking. The only glaring thing, as I look back at this, is the way that the different colored pictures stand out in a mismatching way. It would be good to figure out how to line things up so the appears almost like a grad, but I think you'd have to make some other constraining decisions around the title or small sections of text, forcing inline some places. This would probably interfere with the responsive nature of the page, too.
