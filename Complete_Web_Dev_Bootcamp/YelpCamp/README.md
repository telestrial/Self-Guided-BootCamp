# YelpCamp
Yelpcamp is the capstone project for this bootcamp. It combines all the components learned: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Node, Express, Mongoose, Mongodb, and adds Passport for quicker authentication.

A running version of this project can be found [here](https://aqueous-citadel-80395.herokuapp.com/). Note: Because this is hosted on Heroku, odds are that your first load will take longer than usual. Hang tight. After that, the app should respond as expected.
