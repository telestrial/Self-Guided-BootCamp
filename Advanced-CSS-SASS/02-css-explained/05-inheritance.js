// Propogating property values from parents to children.

// Every CSS property not only must have a value but DOES have a value, if only by
// default.

// Inheritance allows us to write less code, so long as we understand it.
// Properties related to text are inherited: font-family, font-size, color.
// Inheritance of a property only works if no one declares a value for that prop.
// The inherit keyword forces inheritance on a certain property.
// The initial keyword resets a property to its initial value.
