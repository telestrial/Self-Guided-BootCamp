// Set down a guide for the steps you need to take. Interviewers
// look to see what your logic is. They want you to communicate
// your intentions.

// Breaking it down is about going to the MOST basic steps. This
// is where lots of fallacies can be ironed out. As long as you
// do understand the basic steps, you should be able to better
// handle edge cases, if they exist.

// This also demonstrates to your interviewer how you forumalate
// approaches. It can demonstrate compentency all by itself, without
// the solution.

// Some interviews are -all- about process, and the problems you get
// may not actually be reasonably solved in the time given.
