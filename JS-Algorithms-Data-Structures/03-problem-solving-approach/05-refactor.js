// Once you have a solution that works, you aren't done. It is a
// missed opportunity in terms of the interview. You may reflect
// on your code and see something you don't like. Getting to the
// first pillar of "it works" is -VERY- positive, but, if you've
// got the time, demonstrating your willingness to improve your
// code is incredibly valuable.

// Can you derive the result differently?
// Can you understand it at a glance?
// Can you use this code somewhere else and, if so, do you need
// to reform the code to make it more flexible?
// Can you improve the performance of your code?

// Sometimes, you can get through all those questions and still be
// satisfied, and that's fine.
