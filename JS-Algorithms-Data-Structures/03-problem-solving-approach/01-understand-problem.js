// Take the time to understand what is actually needing to be solved.
// It can be easy to end up in the wrong place if you do not know
// where you're going.

// 1. Can you restate the problem in your wods?
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution
//    to the problem?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do you have
//    enough information to solve the problem?
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a
//    part of the problem?

// "Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum."
// 1. Implement addition.
// 2. Two numbers.
// 3. One number..the sum of the two inputs.
// 4. Yes.
// 5. num1, num2 may be better than n and m. Clarity.
