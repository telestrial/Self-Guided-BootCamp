- Javascript and Typescript
- Node, Express
- MongoDb, Mongoose, MySQL
- React (with and without Typescript)

# Table of Contents (In Order of Completion)

Projects are hosted on Heroku and Vercel's free tier, so any project link may take a moment to start up, but, after that, they should otherwise work as expected. You can find images of projects that are not hosted [here](https://imgur.com/a/7Agm9lA).
