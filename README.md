- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4 & 5
- Javascript and Typescript
- Node, Express
- MongoDb, Mongoose
- React (with and without Typescript)

# Table of Contents (In Order of Completion)

Projects are hosted on Heroku and Vercel's free tier, so any project link may take a moment to start up, but, after that, they should otherwise be responsive.

# Todo List (Extra Practice Items)

As I move through this course, I will add items that have challenged me enough that I believe extra practice is necessary to better grasp the subject.

- [x] Create another CRUD implementation using Express. [Use this section as reference](Complete_Web_Dev_Bootcamp/12_Express/03_Restful%20Routes)
  - Done. No code to share...yet. =)
- [x] Learn more about MySQL and Postgres.
  - https://blog.panoply.io/postgresql-vs.-mysql
- [x] Learn more about instance vs. class/static methods.
- [ ] Read [6 Rules of Thumb for MongoDB Schema Design](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post6-rules-of-thumb-for-mongodb-schema-design-part-1)
  - [x] - Part 1
- [ ] Look into [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) by Brad Frost.

# Git Bootcamp

Considering that this repo has always been tracked, taking a course to further my skills that will have me working destructively with git poses some risk to the repo's stability. To avoid breaking anything, this course will be worked on outside of this repository, but its progress will still be tracked here.

- 9/16/2021: Course Intro, Git intro, Installation (1 - 20)
- 9/17/2021: Git Basics - Init, Commit, Workflow (21 - 30)
- 9/18/2021: Git Docs, Atomic Commit Msgs, Git Log, GUI, Amend (31-39)
- 9/19/2021: Branches, HEAD (40-51)
- 9/20/2021: Merging (52-60), Diff (61-71)
