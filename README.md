# Self Study Boot Camp
 This repo's code is a representation of the work involved in a self-guided study of coding with the intention of career placement after 4-6 months time. It may involve several different courses, but, for now, includes work from The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/

5/24/2021: Began work on backend with an introduction to node. Not sure if I will have anything to push, so this is a stand in for that work.
